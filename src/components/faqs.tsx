    question: "What exactly does toneAI do?",
    answer: "We analyze messages to detect irony, sarcasm, and aggression, then suggest appropriate replies. Think of us as your smart friend who's really good at reading between the lines!"
  },
  {
    id: "item-2",
    question: "How accurate is it?",
    answer: "Our AI model is trained on 58 million tweets with 94.6% accuracy in tone detection. But remember, even humans misread messages sometimes!"
  },
  {
    id: "item-3",
    question: "Is my data private?",
    answer: "Your messages are analyzed in real-time and never stored. We value your privacy as much as we value detecting sarcasm (which is a lot!)."
  },
  {
    id: "item-4",
    question: "Will it understand my group chat drama?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Whether it's passive-aggressive work emails or confusing dating app messages, we've got you covered. We're especially good at decoding those tricky 'k.' responses."
  },
  {
    id: "item-5",
    question: "Does it work with emojis?",
    answer: "Yes! We understand that ðŸ™‚ hits different than ðŸ™ƒ. Our AI is fluent in emoji and understands their contextual usage in modern communication."
  },
  {
    id: "item-6",
    question: "How fast does it work?",
    answer: "Lightning fast! We process your messages in under 200ms. That's faster than the time it takes to overthink a response!"
